# About Me

## Before GA:
    I was a full-time computer science student and completed somewhere around 3 years. I also was working full-time for Topgolf, I was with them for just shy of 2 years. My first 7 months was spent as a hospitality manager, the rest of my time I switch roles and did IT, network maintenance and once and a while a little javascript.

## Support I need:
    I need help finding exactly where I want to go and the best way to go about that! 

## Day 1 Goals:
    To have the technical and psychological skills to be able to solve any problem put in front of me and find my home in the industry.

## Two Truths and a Lie
    1. I have 3 cats
    2. I was in the top 1 percent of the US in World of Warcraft 3v3
    3. Jager is amazing
    
## Ideas about where I wanna work
    I would like to work in a medium to a large company. I am highly interested in doing backend engineering or back-up plan very very hevy javascript front end (such as react or angular work).
